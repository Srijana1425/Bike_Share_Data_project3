# 🚲 Explore US Bikeshare Data : Udacity Project

## 🌟 Overview
In this project, you will use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States— **Chicago**, **New_York_City**, and **Washington**. It imports data from CSV files and computes descriptive statistics from the data.

## 📂 Datasets
- `chicago.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `washington.csv`

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. 📥 Download and unzip the project files.
2. 📦 Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy
    ```
3. 🏃‍♂️ Run the script:
    ```bash
    python bikeshare.py
    ```

## 🛠️ Code Explanation
The main functions in the `bikeshare.py` script include:
- `get_filters()`: Prompts user for city, month, and day.
- `load_data(city, month, day)`: Loads and filters data.
- `time_stats(df)`: Displays common travel times.
- `station_stats(df)`: Shows popular stations and trips.
- `trip_duration_stats(df)`: Provides trip duration statistics.
- `user_stats(df)`: Presents user demographics.
- `display_raw_data(df)`: Allows user to view raw data in chunks.
