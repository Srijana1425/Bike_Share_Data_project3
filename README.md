# 🚲 Explore US Bikeshare Data : Udacity Project

## 🌟 Overview
In this project, you will use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States— **Chicago**, **New_York_City**, and **Washington**. It imports data from CSV files and computes descriptive statistics from the data.
## Datasets
- `chicago.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `washington.csv`

## Getting Started
1. Download and unzip project files.
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python bikeshare.py
    ```

## Code Summary
- `get_filters()`: User input for city, month, day.
- `load_data()`: Load and filter data.
- `time_stats()`: Common travel times.
- `station_stats()`: Popular stations.
- `trip_duration_stats()`: Trip duration.
- `user_stats()`: User demographics.
- `display_raw_data()`: View raw data.

## Usage
Run `bikeshare.py` and follow prompts. View statistics and raw data.
